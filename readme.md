# RAG Chatbot
*Built from a tutorial. Broken. Rebuilt for scale, speed, and sanity.*

## ðŸš€ What This Is

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by:

- **LangChain** for prompt/tool orchestration  
- **Pinecone** for vector search  
- **OpenAI** for LLM output  
- **Streamlit** for frontend  

Forked from [LangChain-Pinecone-RAG](https://github.com/ThomasJanssen-tech/LangChain-Pinecone-RAG/tree/main), then *modified like hell* to work with real-world doc loads, forward-compatible Python versions, and tighter dev loops.

## ðŸ”¨ Major Improvements Over the Original

| Area              | Original            | My Upgrade                               |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Ingestion UX      | Silent, brittle     | Credential check + progress bar           |
| Input Handling    | Loose single-PDF    | Folder-based recursive doc loader         |
| Prompt Quality    | Shallow responses   | Deep, customized LLM system prompt        |
| Python Compatibility | Python â‰¤3.10    | Fully working on 3.13                     |
| Frontend          | Stock tutorial      | Branded & modified                        |
| Cleanup           | None                | `deingestion.py` kills your stale indexes |

## ðŸ§  Why I Made These Changes

### âœ… Credential Awareness  
Because eating a stack trace when your env isnâ€™t set is trash. I made it fail loud and clear.

### âœ… Folder-Based Ingestion  
Tutorials are fine with 2 docs. I had **300+**. Subfolder crawl was non-negotiable.

### âœ… Progress Bar for Ingestion  
Because nothing feels worse than staring at your terminal, wondering if it died. Now you get live feedback.

### âœ… Python 3.13 Compatibility  
I live on the bleeding edge. I fix what breaks. Youâ€™re welcome.

### âœ… Prompt Engineering  
The default prompt gave me canned garbage. I rewrote it to force thoughtful, long-form answers tuned to my use case.

### âœ… De-Ingestion Script  
Pinecone ainâ€™t free. If youâ€™re iterating, you *need* index deletion on command. So I made it easy.
